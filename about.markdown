Some things I intend to do with this site are:

1. {% marginnote margin1 %}This contradiction is pointed out in W.V.O. Quine's _Quiddities._{% endmarginnote %} Be wrong, a lot. Given how many things I've been wrong in the past, I'm [almost surely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely) wrong about many things I believe today. The problem is that I don't know which ones (else I'd have tried to correct myself already). Taking the effort to write things down is likely to help me figure out where I'm wrong, and getting feedback and responses from people is likely to help even further.
2. Duck Debugging
3. Be unoriginal [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/64FdKLwmea8MCLWkE/the-neglected-virtue-of-scholarship](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/64FdKLwmea8MCLWkE/the-neglected-virtue-of-scholarship)
4. Correct myself
