        <title>Book: The AI Does Not Hate You by Tom Chivers</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../attention-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attention Conservation Notice:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;I listened to this as an audiobook, which means my recollection will be worse as I have no notes. There is an excellent chance you are not the right audience for this book, refer to the bolded sentence below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First Post</title>
        
          <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wanted only to offer it to you plain and bare, unadorned by a prologue or the endless catalogue of sonnets, epigrams, and laudatory poems that are usually placed at the beginning of books. For I can tell you that although it cost me some effort to compose, none seemed greater than creating the preface you are now reading. I picked up my pen many times to write it, and many times I put it down again because I did not know what to write&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;Miguel de Cervantes, tr. Edith Grossman, Don Quixote&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
