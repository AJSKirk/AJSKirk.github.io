This is a list of books I've read. It's not perfectly complete but it is close to exhaustive for everything since 2015, which is when I started properly tracking the books I read. Most of these books should link to a short review or notes I've written on the book, though I can't guarantee that all will.

This list is mostly non-fiction. Between 2012 and 2017 I read no fiction at all, though I've been slowly adding in more fiction (particularly science fiction and speculative fiction) since then. One result of this is that I don't have a very good lay of the land when it comes to fiction, so recommendations here are especially appreciated. I tend to prefer the kind of fiction writing that can't be captured well in other media, which usually means books with longwinded technical explanations of interesting things (e.g. Herman Melville, Neal Stephenson) or books where the interesting writing style is an integral part of the appeal (e.g. Irvine Welsh, Joseph Heller). If the only appeal is that the book tells a captivating story I'll generally prefer to receive that story in the form of a movie or a TV show.

This link is ranked by quality rather than chronology, meaning books I liked more are closer to the top. Drawing up this ranking from scratch would be hard, so this ranking is generated by a [program I wrote](https://github.com/AJSKirk/VElo) which chooses two books at random and asks me to pick the one I prefer. It then uses the [Elo algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) to turn this a series of binary head-to-head choices into a numeric score for each book, in the same way that rankings of Chess players{% sidenote side1 Or if you prefer, Mark Zuckerberg's website for ranking the attractiveness of female students as featured in _The Social Network_ %} are generated. I run this scoring system from time to time, so there will usually be a number of books in the 'Yet to be Ranked' section at the top of the list.

For the sake of clarity, the question I ask myself when ranking books is "which of these am I more glad to have read", not "which would I recommend to someone" or any variant of that. This is because it's hard to recommend a book in the general case, it's very much dependent on who is receiving the recommendation. As a result, there will almost certainly be books near the top of the list that you won't get any value out of, and books near the bottom of the list which would be an excellent choice for you. If you click through to the review/notes I have on a given book you'll usually see a sentence or two on who (if anyone) I would recommend it to.
