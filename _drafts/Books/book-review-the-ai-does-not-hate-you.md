[_Attention Conservation Notice:_](../attention_policy) _I listened to this as an audiobook, which means my recollection will be worse as I have no notes. There is an excellent chance you are not the right audience for this book, refer to the bolded sentence below._

### Review

_The AI Does Not Hate You_ is a solid introduction to the internet 'rationalist' community, and probably the only good one that exists (including things written by rationalists themselves). Chivers strikes a good balance of being sympathetic and seriousness without compromising his objectivity as an external observer.

The very nature of the book means that it's only really a good fit for a fairly narrow range of people though. There will be a lot of people for whom the ideas that a lot of people in this book are talking about are just too weird, and a sizeable minority of people for whom they'll be so obvious as to be boring. There's some kind of Goldilocks Zone between those two, and I'd summarise it as **if you have read Slate Star Codex but don't read LessWrong then this book is a good fit for you, otherwise it isn't**.

Audiobook was a good format for this. I highlight and take lots of margin notes in books when I want to refer back to things, so losing out on that is the main disadvantage of audiobooks for me. _The AI Does Not Hate You_ is conversational and journalistic rather than technical and academic, so the audio format is a good fit. Chapters are fairly short (10-20 minutes of audio) and fairly independent of each other, so it's easy to bang through one or two at a time while cooking or at the gym or wherever you prefer.

### Thoughts

**Polyamory**

Chivers devotes a chapter to the greater-than-usual number of polyamorous people in rationalist communities, and the fact that this is often offered as evidence in support of the "they're a cult" hypothesis.
